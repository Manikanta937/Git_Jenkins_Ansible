This is CI/CD pipeline integration project done for tools Git, Jenkins and Ansible.

In this project, I have written a playbook using AWS collections to create a S3 bucket which is Ansible used for Deploying and Jenkins is used for build which is triggered by github webhooks.

Git, Github - continous integration
Jenkins - Build 
Ansible - Deploying
